Ramoni:
a) Application Programing Interface. A way to remotely interact with a running application, usually via HTTP protocol.
b) A language that is able to simulate the turing machine. A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine
c) Imperative languages describe commands for the computer to perform. Declarative languages describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming
